Hi, I'm Clarice Groeneveld and I'm the director of the Cordeliers AI 
and Bioinformatics (CAIBI) Core Facility at the Cordeliers Research Center.

Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow at MUST team in the Cordeliers and a 
earned my doctorate at PSL Research University as a member of 
Radvanyi lab at Institut Curie and CIT La Ligue under Aurélien de Reyniès.

I'm passionate about using molecular data to find biological insights that 
can lead to more treatment options for patients. I particularly love exploring
and visualizing shiny new molecular data of all kinds for insights, and creating
tools to do it better, faster or in a more reproducible fashion. I 
have experience with bulk epigenetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data, 
as well as single-cell experiments, spatial transcriptomics and like to
dip my toe into image analysis.

I strive to write and implement well thought-out and documented methods 
to do my research, both methodological and scientific. 
I started this blog to share some code to help myself 
and others to carry out more reproducible research.
