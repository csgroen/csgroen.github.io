Hi, I'm Clarice Groeneveld and I'm currently a doctoral student at PSL Research University as a member of Radvanyi lab at Institut Curie and MEPPOT under Aurélien de Reyniès at Cordeliers Research Institute.

I'm passionate about using molecular data to find biological insights that can lead to more treatment options for patients.

I also love using and implementing well thought-out and documented methods to do my research, and I started this blog to share some code to help myself and others to carry out more reproducible research.
